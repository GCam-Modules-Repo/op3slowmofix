# ONEPLUS 3/3T SLOW MOTION FIX

# What does this module do?

It fixes slow motion by using the libraries containing Oxygen OS Nougat Camera Hal. This will solve the force close when attempting to use slow motion with Google Camera, Snap Camera, Open Camera and similar.

# What Roms is it compatible with?

Every Oreo/Pie-based Rom (including Oxygen OS of course).

# Who did this?

[MarcAnt01](https://github.com/MarcAnt01) updated to new Magisk installer, added device check and other minor stuff.

# Changelog

### V 1.1

Fixed non working slowmo on Customs Roms with SELinux enforcing.

### V 1.0

Initial release

# Known issues

With some Pie Custom Roms that have SELinux enforcing (LOS 16, Havoc OS), the module slows down the camera apps.
